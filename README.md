# Machine Cycle and Memory Comprehension
Assignment Focus
- Exploring machine cycles, registers, and memory operations.
Technical Understanding
- Analyzed the fetch-execute cycle for different instructions, tracking CPU components like PC, MAR, MDR, IR, and A during each step.
- Interpreted sequences of instruction cycles to identify operations like LDA, SUB, ADD, BRZ, and HLT.
- Solved problems involving memory addressing, arithmetic operations, and program control flow.
- Analytical Problem-Solving:
- Applied knowledge of machine instructions and data flow to complete detailed tables and diagrams.
- Identified patterns in instruction sequences to deduce specific machine instructions.
